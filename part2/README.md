# HBnB Flask API

## Overview

The HBnB Flask API is a modular, scalable web application following clear
separation of concerns through the Presentation, Business Logic, and Persistence
layers. This project is built using Flask and organized to accommodate future
integration of persistence mechanisms, such as a database-backed repository. The
current setup implements an in-memory repository to handle object storage and
validation, along with the Facade pattern to manage interaction between layers.
